      <h2>Theme: Modern/Technology</h2>
      <p>For the theme, we decided to go with <strong>Modern/Technology</strong>. It's a pretty simple choice since we’re aiming for a clean, sleek, and professional design that feels up-to-date with current tech trends. We want the site to look modern, but not overly complicated—just something that feels fresh and easy to navigate.</p>

      <h2>How We're Incorporating the Theme</h2>
      <h3>Typography:</h3>
      <p>We’re using <strong>Instrument Sans</strong> as the font. It’s clean and modern, without being too much. We want it to be easy to read and have that techy, professional vibe.</p>

      <h3>Color Palette:</h3>
      <p>We’ll be sticking with cool blues, grays, and some neon accent colors (like electric blue or neon green). The main colors will keep it simple and sleek, and the neon will pop for things like buttons and links, just to make them stand out.</p>

      <h3>Layout and Composition:</h3>
      <p>We’re using <strong>CSS Grid</strong> or <strong>Flexbox</strong> to make sure the layout is responsive. This way, the design will adapt to different screen sizes, which keeps it modern and functional.</p>
      <p>The overall layout will be minimalist, focusing on simplicity and not overcrowding the design. We want enough white space to make everything easy to read.</p>

      <h3>UI Elements:</h3>
      <p>Buttons, nav bars, and other elements will have a simple, clean design, with rounded corners, minimal shadows, and smooth hover effects. Nothing too flashy—just something that works well and looks polished.</p>

      <h3>Animations and Transitions:</h3>
      <p>We’ll add some subtle animations and transitions, like hover effects, to give the design a bit of life without making it feel too busy or distracting.</p>

      <h3>Overall Aesthetic:</h3>
      <p>The overall look will be sharp, clean, and simple. We’re trying to keep it professional and easy to use, without overcomplicating things.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>We’re going for a modern, tech-inspired design that’s clean and functional. Each of us is working on different parts of the project, and we’re using CUBE CSS to keep everything organized and easy to maintain. We just want it to come together in a way that looks good and works well.</p>
